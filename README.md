# Predict the number of crimes on a day of the week using weather

After coming across two articles (see below) about the relationship between weather and crime, I wondered if it would be possible to create a tool to predict the number of crimes on a particular day of the week based on the weather. One usage of this could be to help with staffing for police to help optimise resources.
